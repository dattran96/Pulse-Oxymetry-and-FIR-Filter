# Pulse-Oxymetry-and-FIR-Filter

This project includes the analog-frontend and the digital-backend:

- Analog-frontend: - Signal from dual LED( red led and infrared led) will be amplified through an Op-Amp before it's feed into an ADC.
- Digital-backend: - Controller written in Verilog to generate control sigals for these above dual LED.
                   - FIR Controller written in Verilog to improve the result
